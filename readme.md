## colorsort cpp using sdl2 and gfx

this was set up as an exercise in the insert sort algorithm, used as an excuse to play with sdl2. I ported the app to go and committed it in a [separate repo](https://github.com/jojomickymack/go_colorsort).

to compile this, you will need to have gcc, sdl2, and gfx installed. cmake is recommended since I use it here.
